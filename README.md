# Udacity-Adventure-game
## Project Overview
A simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game.
- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
